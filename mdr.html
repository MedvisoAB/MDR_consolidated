As regards Article 168(4)(c) TFEU, this Regulation sets high standards of quality and safety for medical devices by ensuring, among other things, that data generated in clinical investigations are reliable and robust and that the safety of the subjects participating in a clinical investigation is protected.</p>

Such devices should be subject to the most stringent conformity assessment procedures. In preparation of implementing acts regulating the practical and uniform application of the corresponding requirements laid down in this Regulation, the relevant scientific opinions of the relevant scientific committees should be taken into account.</p>

If there is also a manufacturing date on the label, it does not need to be included in the UDI-PI. If there is only a manufacturing date on the label, this shall be used as the UDI-PI.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">3.6.   Each component that is considered to be a device and is commercially available on its own shall be assigned a separate UDI unless the components are part of a configurable device that is marked with its own UDI.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">3.7.   Systems and procedure packs as referred to in Article 22 shall be assigned and bear their own UDI.</p>

The notified body in question shall document its rationale for the samples taken.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">If the quality management system conforms to the relevant provisions of this Regulation, the notified body shall issue an EU quality management system certificate.

            <p class="oj-normal">4.1.   In addition to the obligations laid down in Section 2, the manufacturer shall lodge with the notified body an application for assessment of the technical documentation relating to the device which it plans to place on the market or put into service and which is covered by the quality management system referred to in Section 2.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.2.   The application shall describe the design, manufacture and performance of the device in question. It shall include the technical documentation as referred to in Annexes II and III.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.3.   The notified body shall examine the application by using staff, employed by it, with proven knowledge and experience regarding the technology concerned and its clinical application. The notified body may require the application to be completed by having further tests carried out or requesting further evidence to be provided to allow assessment of conformity with the relevant requirements of the Regulation. The notified body shall carry out adequate physical or laboratory tests in relation to the device or request the manufacturer to carry out such tests.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.4.   The notified body shall review the clinical evidence presented by the manufacturer in the clinical evaluation report and the related clinical evaluation that was conducted. The notified body shall employ device reviewers with sufficient clinical expertise and, if necessary, use external clinical experts with direct and current experience relating to the device in question or the clinical condition in which it is utilised, for the purposes of that review.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.5.   The notified body shall, in circumstances in which the clinical evidence is based partly or totally on data from devices which are claimed to be equivalent to the device under assessment, assess the suitability of using such data, taking into account factors such as new indications and innovation. The notified body shall clearly document its conclusions on the claimed equivalence, and on the relevance and adequacy of the data for demonstrating conformity. For any characteristic of the device claimed as innovative by the manufacturer or for new indications, the notified body shall assess to what extent specific claims are supported by specific pre-clinical and clinical data and risk analysis.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.6.   The notified body shall verify that the clinical evidence and the clinical evaluation are adequate and shall verify the conclusions drawn by the manufacturer on the conformity with the relevant general safety and performance requirements. That verification shall include consideration of the adequacy of the benefit-risk determination, the risk management, the instructions for use, the user training and the manufacturer's post-market surveillance plan, and include a review of the need for, and the adequacy of, the PMCF plan proposed, where applicable.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.7.   Based on its assessment of the clinical evidence, the notified body shall consider the clinical evaluation and the benefit-risk determination, and whether specific milestones need to be defined to allow the notified body to review updates to the clinical evidence that result from post-market surveillance and PMCF data.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.8.   The notified body shall clearly document the outcome of its assessment in the clinical evaluation assessment report.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.9.   The notified body shall provide the manufacturer with a report on the technical documentation assessment, including a clinical evaluation assessment report. If the device conforms to the relevant provisions of this Regulation, the notified body shall issue an EU technical documentation assessment certificate. The certificate shall contain the conclusions of the technical documentation assessment, the conditions of the certificate's validity, the data needed for identification of the approved design, and, where appropriate, a description of the intended purpose of the device.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.10.   Changes to the approved device shall require approval from the notified body which issued the EU technical documentation assessment certificate where such changes could affect the safety and performance of the device or the conditions prescribed for use of the device. Where the manufacturer plans to introduce any of the above-mentioned changes it shall inform the notified body which issued the EU technical documentation assessment certificate thereof. The notified body shall assess the planned changes and decide whether the planned changes require a new conformity assessment in accordance with Article 52 or whether they could be addressed by means of a supplement to the EU technical documentation assessment certificate. In the latter case, the notified body shall assess the changes, notify the manufacturer of its decision and, where the changes are approved, provide it with a supplement to the EU technical documentation assessment certificate.</p>
